keep everything in mem so far

entities should be derived from getter functions, with methods to access them

- test with session
- complete submit data redirect
- create Q page with data from query string (has button for checkout)
	- connects to server by socket
	- if Q number from socket is own Q number, alert

- admin page with login (venue Id and password)
- redirect to admin page on successful challenge with session
- admin page should get patients and their q number, each with admit button
- when admit is pressed, patient disappears from page and sends a signal to server
- server will send out signal to whatever system is also in place
